# SAR_ADC_with_Bi-direction_CDAC
The design process, a 4-bit SAR ADC and its different component was designed using Cadence Virtuoso software. This SAR ADC system consists of a bootstrapped sample-and-hold switch, a capacitive digital-to-analog converter (DAC), a dynamic comparator, and a SAR logic. Overall, the 4-bit SAR ADC designed and implemented in this project.
