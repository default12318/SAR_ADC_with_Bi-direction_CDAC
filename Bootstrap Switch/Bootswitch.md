The sample-and-hold circuit is basically a switch that captures the value of an analog signal at an instance moment and holds it constant for a certain period of time. In most circuits, there are various ways to implement a switch which may be implemented by an NMOS pass gate, a PMOS pass gate, or a CMOS transmission gate. But these switches are not linear in all operating point that affect the quality of the sampled signal. MOSFET switches are in triode state when they are ON resulting in a non-zero on-resistance R that depends on the input signal. Another effect that depends on the input is the injection of the charge in the inversion layer into the load capacitor when the switch is turning off. This is charge Q. Additionally, there is also clock feedthrough that arises from the presence of parasitic capacitances from the gate of the switch to the output node. The bootstrapped circuit is able to help mitigate some of these linearity issues by keeping the Gate voltage of the switch fixed during the sampling phase.
