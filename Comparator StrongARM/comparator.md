The strong-arm configuration for comparator is a common circuit used in various systems with requirement of low power and linear operating like as a sense amplifier in SRAM memory blocks, a sensitive latch in digital PLLs, and a high-speed comparator in ADCs. Strong-Arm comparators are characterized by their low power consumption (as it consumes almost no Direct Current), high speed (due to its regenerative latch), and full rail-to-rail output swing. On the other hand, the two-stage comparator consists of a preamp stage and a regenerative latch. Introducing the preamp stage into the comparator system separates the output stage from the input nodes reducing the input-referred offset and the kickback noise, in addition to giving an extra gain stage
