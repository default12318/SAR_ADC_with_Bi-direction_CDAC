A transmission gate is a type of electronic switch that is used to control the flow of current in a circuit. It consists of two transistors that are connected in parallel, with the gates of the FETs controlled by a single input signal.
To understand how a transmission gate works, consider the following: Firstly, the input signal is applied to the gates of transistor s. If the input signal is a high voltage, both transistor will turn on, allowing current to flow through the transmission gate. Otherwise, if the input signal is a low voltage, both transistor will turn off, preventing current from flowing through the transmission gate.
The transmission gate is a useful component in electronic circuits because it allows for the efficient switching of signals between different circuit elements. It can also be used as a buffer, to isolate different sections of a circuit, or to multiplex multiple signals onto a single line.
One of the advantages of using a transmission gate is that it has a relatively low power consumption compared to other types of switches. It also has a fast-switching speed and a high degree of input impedance, which makes it useful in high-speed circuits. However, it is not suitable for use in circuits that require a high level of isolation between the input and output.
